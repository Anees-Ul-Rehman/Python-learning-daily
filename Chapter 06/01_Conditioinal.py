# CHAPTER 6 â€“ CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION

# Sometimes we want to play PUBG on our phone if the day is Sunday. 

# Sometimes we order Ice Cream online if the day is sunny.
#  
# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.
# All these are decisions which depend on a condition being met. 

# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met. 

# This is what conditionals are for! 


# IF ELSE AND ELIF IN PYTHON 
# If else and elif statements are a multiway decision taken by our program due to certain conditions in our code.
