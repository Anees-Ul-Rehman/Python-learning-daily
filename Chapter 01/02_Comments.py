# Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute. This can be used to mark author name, date etc.

# TYPES OF COMMENTS 
# There are two types of comments in python. 

# 1. Single Line Comments: To write a single line comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line. 

# This is a Single-Line Comment 

# 2. Multiline Comments: To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string (""" """) 

'''This is an amazing
 example of a Multiline 
 comment!'''

# But now mostly we don't use multlines comments because we comment multilines like this 
# select those lines then press 'ctrl+slash'
