# In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed otherwise not!
 
# If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until the condition becomes False.

# Quick Quiz: Write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop. 

i=1
while(i<51):
    print(i)
    i +=1
else:
    print("done")
# Note:  If the condition never become false, the loop keeps getting executed.


i = 1

while(i<10):
    print(i)
    i +=1
