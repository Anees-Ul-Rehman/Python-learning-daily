# DATA TYPES 
# Primarily these are the following data types in Python: 
a= "1 Integers "
b= "2 Floating point numbers "
c= "3 Strings "
d= "4 Booleans  "
e= "5 None "
print(a,b,c,d,e)

# integers in numbers like 34
# floatinf point numbers in point numbers like 34.4
# any words digit and symbol are in doble quote single quote are strings
# booleans wiil tell us our statement is true or false 



# Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us. 


a = 1 # a is an integer
b=88.4 # b is a floating point numbers
c="Anees Ul Rehman" # c is a strings
d=True # is a booleans variable
e=None # is a none type variable
