# Modules 
# A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs. 

import pyjokes
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
# it will print a random joke
print(joke)

# Printed manually joke 
# print("Are you a RESTful API? because you GET my attention, PUT some love, POST the cutest smile, and DELETE my bad day.")

# TYPES OF MODULES 
# There are two types of modules in Python. 
# 1. Built in Modules (Preinstalled in Python) 
# 2. External Modules (Need to install using pip) 
# Some examples of built in modules are os, random etc. 
# Some examples of external modules are tensorflow, flask etc. 

# One interesting thing is 

# USING PYTHON AS A CALCULATOR 
# We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + ↵ on the terminal. 
# This opens REPL or Read Evaluate Print Loop.
