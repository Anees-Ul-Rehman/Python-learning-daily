# – LOOPS IN PYTHON

# Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance:  Print 1 to 1000. 

# Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to repeat and how! 

# TYPES OF LOOPS IN PYTHON 
# Primarily there are two types of loops in python. 
# • while loops 
# • for loops 
# We will look into these one by one. 

# if a programmer want to print 1 to 5 numbers if he dont't loops so he do like this 
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

# The same tack can be done like this in loops
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
else:
    print('done')



# Quick Quiz: Write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop. 
for i in range(1, 51):
    print(i)
else:
    print("done")
